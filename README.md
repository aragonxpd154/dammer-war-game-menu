In mid-2016, I started an in-depth study of the Blender 3D game development engine, version 2.77 was operating at the time and the software included new features with the cycles rendering engine, in light of this desire to develop new skills in oriented programming lines. three-dimensional objects and the sum of previous knowledge of panda3d, I started to develop the menu and a physics simulation of a jeep that would be used for academic purposes and personal studies. Unfortunately the BGE engine (blender 3d) is no longer available in the latest versions, however you can run the project by downloading a version prior to 2.77 from the Blender Foundation website. I leave this project available for study purposes and the script source code and the .blend file for posterity

## :information_source: How To Use

This project directory contains a folder with its respective version (in a subfolder), the electronic schematic and the layout of the printed circuit board (PCB) and compiled code, which is specific to each function of the 8bit computer.

Always check and/or use the highest numbered version or most recent modification described in the commit for example:

Old version:

```bash
...directory...\1.0V
```

latest version:

```bash
...directory...\2.1V
```

To clone and download all project directories you can use [Git](https://git-scm.com), or any other specific program.

To clone the current directory use the command:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/aragonxpd154/8-bits-computer
```

## â˜• Do It Yourself

As soon as I finish all the branches of this project I will make available a final version of the package with a detailed description for you to be able to assemble your own 8bit computer. Only a pre-release version was available, with the passing of these months I should provide a more complete version.

## ðŸ’» Development Status

The revision of all the directories of this project has already started, with each commit I will be providing a description of what was changed in each revision. The review process is below:

- [ ] Reviewer ACC REGISTER
- [ ] Reviewer ARITHMETIC LOGIC UNIT
- [ ] Reviewer ASSEMBLY LAYOUT
- [ ] Reviewer ASTABLE AND MONOSTABLE CLOCK CIRCUIT
- [ ] Reviewer B REGISTER
